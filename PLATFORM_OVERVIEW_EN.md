## 🎯 Platform Overview

**PBL-LMS** is a modern educational platform designed to implement **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** methodology, where students learn through practical, real-world projects rather than traditional lecture-based approaches.

### Platform Goals:
- ✅ Implement Project-Based Learning methodology
- ✅ Provide continuous and objective student assessment
- ✅ Track student progress in real-time
- ✅ Create collaborative environment between students and instructors
- ✅ Develop practical skills alongside theoretical knowledge

---

## 🌟 Core Features

### 1. **Structured Sequential Projects**

The platform offers **7 progressively designed projects** from basic to advanced:

```
Project 1 (Beginner) → Project 2 → Project 3 → Project 4
            ↓
      Project 5 (Advanced) → Project 6 (Expert/Capstone)
```

#### Project Details:

| # | Project Name | Level | Description | Skills |
|---|-------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Introduction to Electronics | Beginner | Basic components & circuit diagrams | Fundamentals, Diagram Reading |
| 2 | Simple Circuit Design | Beginner | Building practical circuits from scratch | Practical Design, Testing |
| 3 | Embedded Programming (Arduino) | Intermediate | Microcontroller programming & device control | Programming, Controllers |
| 4 | Sensor Systems | Intermediate | Using various sensors & data collection | Sensing, Data Processing |
| 5 | Smart Automation (IoT) | Advanced | Building connected intelligent systems | IoT, Integration, Security |
| 6 | Capstone Project | Expert | Student-selected integrated project | All previous skills |

## 📊 Assessment Methodology

The platform uses a **3-Phase Evaluation System**:

### Phase 1: Group Evaluation
**Focus:** Team collaboration and group performance

- Entire group evaluated as a single unit
- Assessment criteria: Collaboration, Role Distribution, Work Quality
- All team members receive the same group phase score
- Tool: Comprehensive Observation Cards

### Phase 2: Individual Assessment
**Focus:** Individual student competency

- Individual assignments or tasks
- Assesses understanding of the concepts
- Each student receives their own score
- Measures: Problem-solving, Application, Individual Contribution

### Phase 3: Oral Examination
**Focus:** Verbal communication and deep understanding

- Direct conversation with supervisor/instructor
- Questions about concepts and decisions
- Ability to explain and defend ideas
- Each student receives individual score

### Final Grade Calculation

```
Final Grade = (Group Score × 40%) + (Individual Score × 30%) + (Oral Score × 30%)

Passing Requirement: Final Grade ≥ 60%
Reassessment Options: Up to 3 attempts per phase
```

### Practical Example:
```
Student in Arduino Project:
- Group scored: 85%
- Individual score: 75%
- Oral score: 80%

Final = (85 × 0.4) + (75 × 0.3) + (80 × 0.3) = 80.5% ✅ PASSED
```
